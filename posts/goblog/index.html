<p>If you would&rsquo;ve Googled me ten years ago, you probably would&rsquo;ve ended up on my personal blog. Slowly this personal blog got replaced by all sorts of (social) channels. Facebook. Tumblr. Medium. And website builders like Squarespace. I don&rsquo;t mind using these channels and services, but I regret neglecting and eventually ditching my blog. I think it&rsquo;s healthy to keep some sort of archive. And it&rsquo;s fun right, having this place on the web that&rsquo;s really <em>yours</em>. I appreciate initiatives like <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a>, a community of personal websites that own their domain, data and even use it as a primary identity online.</p>

<p>I love how I can still browse to <a href="https://www.zeldman.com">Zeldman.com</a> or <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/">Andy Budd&rsquo;s blog</a> and find this immense archive. I also think that having your own space has a lower threshold to post stuff that interests you. It&rsquo;s less influenced by likes, claps or retweets. <a href="https://adactio.com">Adactio</a> has more personality than any social media profile I can think of.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s weird, I miss the old web, while it&rsquo;s still here. Instead of regretting choices of the past, it was time to make new choices. I don&rsquo;t plan on blogging a lot, but at least what I write can be found on something I <em>own</em>.</p>

<h2 id="go-with-hugo">Go with Hugo</h2>

<p>With that in mind I had to decide on how to run this blog. I have a lot of experience with Wordpress and other Content Management Systems, but wanted to try something new. In the past I&rsquo;ve worked with static site generators, like <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">Middleman</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> (both are based on Ruby). There is no database or server-side stuff needed when you publish. This has another advantage, you can host the website as a <a href="Github Pages">https://pages.github.com</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to go for <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, which runs on Go. Hugo is well maintained and I wanted to know a little bit more about Go (although you actually don&rsquo;t really need to learn Go, to use Hugo).</p>

<p>Just like most of the static site generators, it uses Markdown files to generate blog posts as static html. You can add a CMS with a service like <a href="http://forestry.io">Forestry</a>. Even if Hugo isn&rsquo;t the right fit, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. I can just copy or export the Markdown files to an alternative. I hope this makes it more future proof than previous websites.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see if we can still read this blog post in 2028.</p>
